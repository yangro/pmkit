# Stakeholder Simulator

Get feedback from simulated CTO, UX, Sales, Executive, and User Advocate perspectives — before your real meeting.

## When to Use This Skill

- Pressure-testing a PRD before review meetings
- Anticipating concerns from specific stakeholders
- Preparing for exec presentations

## What You'll Need

- A document to review (PRD, proposal, one-pager)
- Context on your organization (optional)

## Process

### Step 1: Submit Document

Provide the full document you want reviewed.

### Step 2: Select Perspectives

Choose which stakeholders to simulate:

- **CTO/Tech Lead:** Technical feasibility, architecture, timeline realism
- **UX Lead:** User experience, design complexity, usability concerns
- **Sales Lead:** Market fit, competitive positioning, demo-ability
- **Executive:** Strategy alignment, ROI, opportunity cost
- **User Advocate:** Customer needs, adoption friction, support implications

### Step 3: Generate Reviews

Each persona reviews with their priorities and concerns. For each stakeholder:

- Overall stance (🟢 Supportive / 🟡 Concerns / 🔴 Blocker)
- What they like
- Their concerns (with specific questions they'd ask)
- Suggestions for addressing their concerns

### Step 4: Synthesize

After individual reviews:

- Where do perspectives align? (Your easy wins)
- Where do they conflict? (Prepare for these tensions)
- What questions should you prepare answers for?

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Include full context** — The more detail in your doc, the more specific the feedback
2. **Add org context** — If your CTO is risk-averse or your exec cares deeply about timeline, mention it
3. **Use 24 hours before** — Give yourself time to address concerns before the real meeting
4. **Focus on yellow/red flags** — Green stakeholders don't need prep; concerns and blockers do

## Framework Reference

**Multi-perspective stakeholder analysis:**
- Different roles optimize for different outcomes
- Surfacing conflicts early prevents meeting derailment
- Preparing answers in advance builds credibility
