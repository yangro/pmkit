# PMKit
 
**Claude skills for product managers.**
 
Turn Claude into a PM operating system. Load a skill, paste your doc, get structured output in seconds.

## The Problem
 
You're using AI wrong.
 
Every session starts from zero. You copy-paste context. You re-explain your product. You manually format the output into something usable.
 
It feels productive. It isn't.
 
**PMKit fixes this.** Each skill is a pre-built workflow that knows what inputs it needs, applies a proven PM framework, and outputs something you can actually use.
 
No prompt engineering. No starting from scratch. Just results.

## What's a Skill?
 
A skill is a markdown file that teaches Claude how to do a specific PM task. It includes:
 
- **When to use it** — What situations trigger this skill
- **What inputs it needs** — So Claude asks the right questions
- **The methodology** — Proven frameworks (Cagan, Teresa Torres, etc.)
- **Output template** — Consistent, structured, ready to use
 
You provide context. Claude applies the framework. You get output in seconds, not hours.

## Example: Stakeholder Simulator
 
**Before:** You walk into a a cross-functional product team meeting. You are about to discuss upcoming plans for your feature coming out next month. The CTO asks about technical feasibility. Sales asks about positioning. The exec asks about opportunity cost. You scramble.
 
**After:** You paste your PRD into Claude with this skill loaded. In 2 minutes, you get:
 
- 5 stakeholder reviews (CTO, UX, Sales, Exec, User Advocate)
- Where they'll agree (your easy wins)
- Where they'll conflict (prepare for these)
- The exact questions you'll be asked
- Suggested talking points
 
You walk in prepared. Zero surprises.

## Why This Exists
 
I spent 10+ years as a product leader. I've written hundreds of PRDs, sat through thousands of stakeholder reviews, and learned the hard way which frameworks actually work.
 
PMKit is what I wish I had — an operating system that multiplies PM output instead of just answering questions.
